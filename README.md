# Floor-Cleaning-Robot
This is my attempt at making a (knockoff) Roomba aka a floor-cleaning robot. I wanted to work on a project over winter break and one of my friends suggested this for some reason, so I was like why not? Please keep in mind that this is still a very rough build and there is a lot of stuff I could improve on for this project and also a lot of stuff that I still want to do. I can elaborate on this later, but basically it would have been way better if I actually could get reliable access to a 3d printer... 
As you can see in the following picture of the roomba (I'll be calling it that from now on), a lot of it is being held on with cardboard and tape.
