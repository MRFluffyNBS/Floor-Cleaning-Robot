# Floor-Cleaning-Robot
This is my attempt at making a (knockoff) Roomba aka a floor-cleaning robot. I wanted to work on a project over winter break and one of my friends suggested this for some reason, so I was like why not? Also, I kind of needed some robotics-oriented experience because I have never done robotics before in high school and so many people in my college seem to have.
